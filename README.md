# RDM Display

RDM Display exhibits two electric traction motors, inverters, wheels, electronic park brakes, and wheels. The display can spin the wheels programmatically to illustrate the potential of torque vectoring and finite control. The motors can spin the wheels in either forward or backward direction independently.

## Code
The back end code is purely written in Python and the GUI is written in QML/Javascript with Qt5 development platform. Data between Python and QML is relayed using signals and slots concept. In order to make changes to the GUI, understanding of QML and property bindings are important.

## Tools & Libraries
